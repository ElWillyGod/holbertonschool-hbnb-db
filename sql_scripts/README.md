# SQL SCRIPTS
---

## What
  Here lie both scripts for local databases and scripts to run upon the
startup of the sqldb container. As mysql runs scripts in alphabetical order,
they are ordered with numbers to control what script goes first.

1. Tables creation
2. MySQL users creation and permission grants.
3. Admin users insertion to hbnb db.
4. Default amenities insertion to hbnb db.
5. Countries insertion to hbnb db.

  There is also the ".env" and "config-file.cnf" files to config MySQL to
behave as expected.
